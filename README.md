"#IP_Address_logic" 

this is a rudimental C app for understanding the mechanisms behind IP classles Address.
Given a IP address and its netmask, written in the /x format it automaticly calculates:
1)the net [prefix] of the IP address
2)the broadcast of the given IP address
3)generates the bit array of netmask and IP address
4)the maximum number of users for the given IP address

In the future there will be a implementation in JS considering also IP address and netmask manipulation (where the user
can edit the netmask or the IP address and view the changhes on the broadcast, host and number of user it can host), and an intuitive graphical interface.
